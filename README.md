### Title of Paper:
Medical Image Classification: Knowledge Transfer via Residual U-Net and Vision Transformer-Based Teacher-Student Model with Knowledge Distillation

### Remarks:
Due to some of our data being private and considering patient privacy concerns, we have not provided the download method for the private dataset. Additionally, as our subsequent work builds upon the foundation of this project, we have made modifications to the original code. However, to ensure the reproducibility of this work, we have restored the core code for both the teacher and student models.

### Datasets:
- **COVID-19 Radiography Dataset:** This dataset comprises 3,616 images of COVID-19-positive cases, 10,192 normal cases, 6,012 images of non-COVID-19 lung infections, and 1,345 images of viral pneumonia.
- **BreaKHis Dataset:** The BreaKHis dataset includes 9,109 microscopic images of breast tumor tissue collected from 82 patients. These images are captured at different magnification levels and consist of 2,480 benign samples and 5,429 malignant samples.
- **IDC Dataset:** This dataset originates from 162 whole-slide breast cancer pathology images, from which 277,524 image patches were extracted. It comprises 198,738 IDC-negative image patches and 78,786 IDC-positive image patches.
- **Brain Stroke Dataset:** This dataset was provided by a collaborating hospital and contains 28 images of brain hemorrhage patients, 47 images of brain stroke patients, and 35 images of healthy individuals' brain scans.
